# CoronaMelderCDN
Copy of the data uploaded to the Corona Melder CDN, including parsed exposure keysets

The script `fetch.py` gets the data from the CDN and pushes to github.
The `cdn_pb2.py` file was generated using Google's protobuf compiler and should not be changed by hand.

First fetch was on 05-10-2020.

The folder `WebsiteGenerator` contains a script that estimates the number of real uploads and generates plots that are hosted on GitHub pages.
